# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Project Warm Up

## Where's the Action

### Intro

As a developer creating apps, you'll need to find ways to inform your users which button or link is currently "active".  This will need to be accomplished in the List Pagination and Filter Project.  Here’s some lightweight practice working with a short collection of buttons.  You’ll use JavaScript to remove the "active" class name from all buttons and add it to the most recently clicked button.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.
